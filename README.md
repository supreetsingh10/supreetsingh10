Hi, I am Supreet. Welcome to my repo. I am committed to become a great musician and a great software engineer.
I love the opensource communities, and I love how they have shaped the entire ecosystem in tech. I owe my career in tech to
Vim, Neovim, PopOs, and Manjaro. 


I am currently studying the internals of the Linux Kernel, Rust and C++. 


Projects that I have completed in Rust include 
- Noterm: Sticky notes for the terminal
- Lyricist: Touch typing trainer which trains you on the song lyrics


I am also writting my own programming language, I call it Voodoo. It is compiled and stricly typed programming language which is written in C++. I have finished writing the lexer and on the final stages of the 
parser.


Wish me all the best.
